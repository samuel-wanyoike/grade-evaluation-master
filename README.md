# Problem Statement - Grade Evaluation

The management and teachers at a School have conducted exams for their high school students and the evaluation of the answer scripts has also been completed. The teachers with the help of a technical team need to put a system in place to automate the grading process. ​

Develop an application to calculate the grades of students ​in a class and display the grades along with the ​student names. Ensure the grade is calculated ​only after the total marks and average marks ​of the student has been calculated.​
